    <!-- In index.html, press shift + ! and you should see some boilerplate HTML.
Create a personal website to market yourself as a developer. Don't worry about coming up with all the text, just use a lorem ipsum generator. The web page should have:
A header element with the following child elements:
An <h1> element with your name
An <h2> element with your job title
An <aside> element with your bio:
An <h3> heading
A <p> element with your bio text
An <img> element with a picture of yourself
A <section> element for the techologies you'll know at the end of this program. It should contain:
An <h3> heading
A bulleted list of at least three languages. (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are fine for now.)
A <section> element about your work experience. It should contain:
An <h3> heading
An <article> element for each major point in your work history
A <footer> element with the text "Built by [your name]" -->
